dog or two some fish and maybe a mexican black kingsnake and rats again [which compared to the pets we have now doesnt sound like a lot]. ive found that ill make any excuse to look at animals be it

when you fed bella! its always so adorable!"],["Rogan Shannon",112133.0,"it seems to me that the history of writing is often romanticized.  the four places in history that developed writing systems were due to having actual needs - agriculture for growing communities required more brain power than individuals could muster.  they needed to offload their past learning into written documents.  this way new people can learn what to do without bugging the few people already know effectively creating government ordinances.  seeing the power of communicating across distances some people borrowed the governments writing system and tailored it for their own purposes.  the most effective motivator for learning to read and write has always been a government requiring someone to understand a writing system under punishment of losing money.i believe writing to be useful as an alternate rendering of ideas.  yes asl videos capture your meaning accurately for someone who knows asl.  it has a lot of nuance that culturally literate people may notice.  but the closed captions are there to eliminate the nuances.  you use standard spelling and proper grammar so others can look up your meaning even if they are not culturally literate english speakers.if you had published your captions in a blog post people can actually read four times faster than your speech / signing.  i could skim the paragraphs of the blog post quickly looking for something that is relevant to me.  it can be indexed by google or i can just use the find feature in my browser for particular words.  it can be automatically (though poorly) translated into hundreds of other languages.  i can print it out and highlight parts of it for review later.  dictionary writers encyclopedias magazines books newspapers etc. can use your blog post as source material.aslwrite or si5s could realize these kind benefits.  my personal take is that an alphabet is better than picture writing because it doubles as an index.  i created the aslsj writing system because i wanted to use asl words in my computer programs.  it only uses the alphabets letters so i could upload the closed captions for your video in aslsj today.your video starts with the asl word hello.  in english each letter of a word phonetically tells you how to move your lips tongue and throat to pronounce the word.  in aslsj the word bepo-r phonetically tells you to put your open-b handshape (the first two letters - be) in front of your chin (the next letter - p) with the palm turned out (next letter - o) then move the hand to the right (-r).  bepo-r is an asl idea.  it does not require translation into english and it does not require an artists painting like aslwrite or si5s.  now i can create a dictionary to hold that word and thousands more.  unfortunately it wouldnt help because nobody would want to read it - so were back to square one."],["peahix",21953.0,"now thats the sea world i remember  :)"],["The Dodo",24401.0,"a very nice

this video made me really bad for my hermit crabs. i have three of them and i cannot take care of them i do try and take care of them as much as i can but i know theyre not happy and i feel really bad. i have no idea what to do so i came to this video for help but instead it made me feel really bad.</td></tr><tr><td>Viktor Larkhill</td><td>69901.0</td><td>you are the best human

entire life. my parents both had pets as children. my dad has kept fish since he was a child - my grandad even kept fish that have since become illegal to import into the uk and they both had dogs growing up [my grandad had a gorgeous pyrenees x st bernard]. weve had 8 cats 3 dogs 6 rats 5 guinea pigs chinese water dragon crested gecko poison dart frogs stick insects crabs and too many fish currently 5 cats 3 dogs and the fish [though i plan to get a ball python soon]. when i move out i want to limit myself more than my parents have. i would love to have a ball python a dog or two some fish and maybe a mexican black kingsnake and rats again [which compared to the pets we have now doesnt sound like a lot]. ive found that ill make any excuse to look at animals be it ducks at the lake pets in a pet store zoos which does frustrate my friends and bore my family but its one of the few things that im passionate about and as long as owners can provide care for their animals it shouldnt matter whether someone else thinks they have too many.</td></tr><tr><td>Brave Wilderness</td><td>46471.0</td><td>i love this channel because it is so interesting and teaches me about animals and some

fear of spiders. with the pack i would go on an adventure (over a break probably). i would see what animals i find (although not too close). stay wild coyote!! i‚Äôll see you in your next

me that the history of writing is often romanticized.  the four places in history that developed writing systems were due to having actual needs - agriculture for growing communities required more brain power than individuals could muster.  they needed to offload their past learning into written documents.  this way new people can learn what to do without bugging the few people already know effectively creating government ordinances.  seeing the power of communicating across distances some people borrowed the governments writing system and tailored it for their own purposes.  the most effective motivator for learning to read and write has always been a government requiring someone to understand a writing system under punishment of losing money.i believe writing to be useful as an alternate rendering of ideas.  yes asl videos capture your meaning accurately for someone who knows asl.  it has a lot of nuance that culturally literate people may notice.  but the closed captions are there to eliminate the nuances.  you use standard spelling and proper grammar so others can look up your meaning even if they are not culturally literate english speakers.if you had published your captions in a blog post people can actually read four times faster than your speech / signing.  i could skim the paragraphs of the blog post quickly looking for something that is relevant to me.  it can be indexed by google or i can just use the find feature in my browser for particular words.  it can be automatically (though poorly) translated into hundreds of other languages.  i can print it out and highlight parts of it for review later.  dictionary writers encyclopedias magazines books newspapers etc. can use your blog post as source material.aslwrite or si5s could realize these kind benefits.  my personal take is that an alphabet is better than picture writing because it doubles as an index.  i created the aslsj writing system because i wanted to use asl words in my computer programs.  it only uses the alphabets letters so i could upload the closed captions for your video in aslsj today.your video starts with the asl word hello.  in english each letter of a word phonetically tells you how to move your lips tongue and throat to pronounce the word.  in aslsj the word bepo-r phonetically tells you to put your open-b handshape (the first two letters - be) in front of your chin (the next letter - p) with the palm turned out (next letter - o) then move the hand to the right (-r).  bepo-r is an asl idea.  it does not require translation into english and it does not require an artists painting like aslwrite or si5s.  now i can create a dictionary to hold that word and thousands more.  unfortunately it wouldnt help because nobody would want to read it - so were back to square one.</td></tr><tr><td>peahix</td><td>21953.0</td><td>now thats the sea world i remember  :)</td></tr><tr><td>The Dodo</td><td>24401.0</td><td>a very nice

for all those that are mixed or pure because ya all know as well as i do love is love. i hate the name pitbull because it was the name given by dog fighters. ive found people respond better with the

reproduction is also essential and evolving for them just because we love specific kind of animals and started giving them shelter that is the only way for their sustainance before our interference cats and dogs were living on their own in nature. whats wrong is government and society to think that a particular land belongs to them n if animals want to live on that space they have to live according to our rules. you can never even think about a rule to stop a poor or weak human from reproduction bt this is so ok to spay n neuter animals</td></tr><tr><td>Brave

and they dont. my birth mother would pop me every blue moon and all it did was annoy me she married a prick who spanked and it hurt like hell and i thought wont be doing that (bad behavior) again.however as i said stepfather was a prick and after some 20+ serious spankings i made up my mind not to cry or show signs of pain during and after the spankings because i hated him. this infuriated him my goal. my point is one has to know who they are dealing with to use any kind of correction have to know how far to push and when to know this or that correction is not or no longer effective.ive said before i like clint in the sense that he teaches a lot of the same things rick does however he uses bits and he doesnt have the same softness or compassion rick has for

riders cimb off and that was it. and they might have repeated that a few times and after a while they started to slowly increase the commands. like either they decide the gate or the direction but the horse get to decide the other one. i thought that would be a good slow training method. but maybe you have another idea about it rick. i guess they still did learn the horse what it meant to give

teor√≠a la portada muestra la fecha 22 de marzo de 2016 y teniendo en cuenta que los bailes de instituto tienen lugar generalmente en oto√±o el de spider-man: homecoming probablemente tuvo lugar en

tener lugar en oto√±o de 2016? si ese es el caso encaja con la frase de happy al final cuando dice que han estado llevando el anillo desde 2008 y que iron man 2 tiene lugar solo unos meses despu√©s de iron man 1. por tanto la frase de ‚Äúocho a√±os despu√©s‚Äù a√∫n requerir√≠a que los vengadores se hubiesen reunido en 2008. pero como tanto thor como el incre√≠ble hulk tienen lugar durante la semana grande de furia (al mismo tiempo que iron man 2) entonces la consistencia a√∫n se mantiene. en los vengadores furia dice que el grueso tuvo lugar ‚Äòel a√±o pasado‚Äô lo cual podr√≠a ser en cualquier

i would suggest focusing more on hard evidence. if theres so much trampling down of the undergrowth and so many paths that they frequent not to mention  the amount of work they are  supposedly putting in to all these structures there should be physical evidence left behind of them doing so. hair blood tracks physical impressions they left behind. this is what you should really focus on capturing. they very well could be leaving behind all these structures... but honestly ive seen pine beetle dead falls that look nearly identical. the whistle you captured was quite unexpected.. maybe work on capturing new audio evidence too.the teepee was interesting as well but how do we the viewer know that wasnt you or another person?? we dont thats why i would suggest focusing on finding hard evidence to support your claim.  but continuously showing these xs and perches that really look like nothing but dead fall with no other evidence to back them up. its just speculation im afraid. i want to see evidence of their existence just like everyone else does. but unfortunately without hard evidence to back up what you believe is happening up there... its just that speculation and speculation only. not trying to ruffle any feathers here.. just some constructive criticism. if you can find evidence to back up your claim it would be amazing.</td><td>false</td><td>true</td></tr><tr><td>Gohan The

some 20+ serious spankings i made up my mind not to cry or show signs of pain during and after the spankings because i hated him. this infuriated him my goal. my point is one has to know who they are dealing with to use any kind of correction have to know how far to push and when to know this or that correction is not or no longer effective.ive said before i like clint in the sense that he teaches

and after a while the riders cimb off and that was it. and they might have repeated that a few times and after a while they started to slowly increase the commands. like either they decide the gate or the direction but the horse get to decide the other one. i thought that would be a good slow training method. but maybe you have another idea about it rick. i guess they still did learn the horse what

que la car√°tula del blu-ray de la pel√≠cula contiene la clave para que el filme encaje perfectamente en la l√≠nea temporal del universo cinematogr√°fico de marvel. seg√∫n la teor√≠a la portada muestra la fecha 22 de marzo de 2016 y teniendo en cuenta que los bailes de instituto tienen lugar generalmente en oto√±o el de spider-man: homecoming probablemente tuvo lugar en oto√±o de 2016 lo que encajar√≠a con lo de ‚Äúocho a√±os despu√©s‚Äù: si la portada interior muestra 22 de marzo de 2016 y los bailes de instituto son generalmente en oto√±o ¬øpodr√≠a la pel√≠cula tener lugar en oto√±o de 2016? si ese es el caso encaja con la frase de happy al final cuando dice que han estado llevando el anillo desde 2008 y que iron man 2 tiene lugar solo unos meses despu√©s de iron man 1. por tanto la frase de ‚Äúocho a√±os despu√©s‚Äù a√∫n requerir√≠a que los vengadores se hubiesen reunido en 2008. pero como tanto thor como el incre√≠ble hulk tienen lugar durante la semana grande de furia (al mismo tiempo que iron man 2) entonces la consistencia a√∫n se mantiene. en los vengadores furia dice que el grueso tuvo lugar ‚Äòel a√±o pasado‚Äô lo cual podr√≠a ser en cualquier momento desde d√≠as despu√©s de empezar 2008 hasta varios meses despu√©s. con esto en mente siete a√±os y unos cuantos meses podr√≠a haberse redondeado a ocho
